    <h3>Design Decisions:</h3>
      I decided to plot age aginst transfer value, because using the categorical data (leagues/teams)
      on x axis would be difficult since there are so many more ages than leagues. Also, either 
      a shape encoding or size encoding would be made, and it would be harder to analyze the trend 
      and correlation of player age and their transfer value. A scatterplot format was used because 
      the data I was plotting involved two axes with quantative data. This led me to believe that it 
      would be best to use a position encoding, since I was graphing age against a monetary value,
      both numerical. Since each league had different players incoming, I wanted to differentiate
      the leagues so that proper analysis can be done on the players (how much teams in a league 
      spend, age of players they tend to buy). The best choice for this was a color encoding to 
      separate leagues (because there was a good amount to categorize, all having numerous players/points).
      A shape encoding was considered here, but colors were much easier to see than shapes when graphed;
      Since I wanted the feature of analyzing each league, I used dynamic query filters so that
      the user could pick the leagues they wanted to analyze. I did this with chekboxes. Originally I was
      going to do a dropdown for the user to select one league, but this wouldn't allow analysis on multiple
      leagues at once so I decided the checkbox would be a better strategy. I used tooltips as well because
      there was more information that the user would be interested in such as name, position, and the team
      that they player left/joined. It was easier to display with a tooltip than a table, much more elegant 
      and visually pleasing. This could lead to some problems due to point overlap, so I decided to use sliders
      to change ranges of axes. This allows users for more simplified control compared to zooming because they 
      can set exact ranges, and can evaluate whatever they need. This allows for users to analyze a certain part
      and deal with the overlap issue in one go. There were also sliders for point size and point opacity that
      were used instead of textboxes or a form. This was done so I could set the range to what I thought was appropriate
      for proper visibility more simply, while still allowing the user some control in case they have issues with their
      eyesight. Sliders also are more visually appealing and easier to use than a textbox in my opinion.
    <h3>Development Process</h3>
      My process started with finding an interesting dataset and extracting it. Then I looked at the types of data
      and figured out the relationship/correlation I wanted to show in my data. I decided on fee and age axes, because 
      age is very important when it comes to player transfers, and can either encourage or deter a team to obtain a player.
      Then I decided on encodings and after experimenting with shapes, size, colors, and position I thought color/position
      encodings for a scatterplot would be best. Then came interactions. This was the hardest/most time consuming part, 
      because when selecting leagues (checkboxes) and manipulating sliders, I had to constantly update the graph. This alongiside 
      imposing and monitoring restrictions was something I had to make sure my code did. After deciding on everything I created margins
      and started to code, adjusting and making small tweaks  as I went throughout, experimenting with different combinations and looks.
      It roughly took about 3-4 days of work (not constant) to complete.<h1></h1>
